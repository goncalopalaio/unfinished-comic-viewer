== README

This is a simple rails app that is supposed to list comics and their chapters.
Mostly built to try out React.js so it is really thrown together and incomplete.

- Frontend is handled with React
- Data is sourced from mangaeden
- The db is populated using a cli task (see unfinished-comic-viewer/app/helpers/eden_helper.rb)
